            The Mindset Kit was created by <a href="https://www.perts.net" target="_blank">The Project for Education Research that Scales (PERTS)</a>, a research center in the psychology department at Stanford University. Our goal is to create a place where educators and parents can learn about and find the most effective learning mindset materials available. All of our resources are based on research that has been carefully translated into lessons and practices intended to improve studentsâ€™ mindsets and make them better learners. We currently offer targeted materials for teachers and parents to ensure our messaging is as effective as possible.

          <h3>What exactly is a &ldquo;learning mindset?&rdquo;</h3>

          <p>
            Learning mindsets are a set of beliefs that are linked to increased academic performance in students. There are three main learning mindsets we commonly reference: <b>growth mindset</b>, <b>belonging</b>, and <b>purpose &amp; relevance</b>. Each has its own unique characteristics and is based on years of research.

                <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
                <p>
                  Students are more likely to persist through challenges when they understand that intelligence is malleable, rather than a fixed trait.

                <p>

                <p>
                  When students believe that schoolwork has a purpose and relates to their life outside of school, they are more eager to learn.

          <h3>Growth and fixed mindset</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, most topics in the Mindset Kit are built for teaching and understanding a growth mindset (and its counterpart &mdash; a fixed mindset). We have several videos to help you learn more about these mindsets and example practices that can help you get started.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can select a topic from our
            <a href="/">home page</a>
            that best fits your interests. Or, if you are interested in researching the science behind some of the other learning mindsets, we suggest reading more on the

            Open collaboration
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Mindset Kit is a place to find <b><i>all</i></b> the best resources and practices related to learning mindsets. PERTS creates much of its own content, but we also partner with individuals and organizations to make our content better. Some of our most popular resources are the <a href="/growth-mindset/teaching-growth-mindset/growth-mindset-lesson-plan">growth mindset lesson plan</a> we made in collaboration with Khan Academy and the practice videos we made with the Teaching Channel. We are hard at work improving all our materials and building new topics to explain other learning mindsets and to reach a wider audience. We encourage potential partners to reach out to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the Mindset Kit has a <a href="/search">resource library</a> where we encourage our visitors to post their own materials. PERTS strongly values a growth mindset and we understand that we can learn even more by working with specialists and practitioners&mdash;from school principals to enthusiastic parents.
          </p>

            What have we learned so far?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We care deeply about our collaborations with teachers and with school districts so that we can learn what is working, what is challenging, and what resources or knowledge are missing.
          </p>

            In February 2016, we released a report titled,
            <a href="/static/files/Mindset_Kit_Engagement_Report.pdf"
               target="_blank"
               ng-click="trackDownload('Mindset_Kit_Engagement_Report.pdf')">
              Promoting Learning Mindsets in Schools: Lessons from Educators' Engagement with the PERTS Mindset Kit</a>.
            This report highlights what we have learned about how educators are using the Mindset Kit resources, what challenges they encounter, and what areas for future development have emerged. These findings may be of value to educators, policymakers, and foundations interested in supporting broad adoption of mindset supporting practices and policies.
